# IA


For the moment we have implemented a random AI. It chooses a card and a number of boxes. It will then randomly select the selected hexagons.

Thus, rules that do not impose many conditions on the selected hexagons will be favored. This is why the technology wheel and the placement of a city will be the most played cards.

## Running the IA

To start the IA you have to join a game with "IA" or "random" as player name.
