# Development process

## Project philosophy

During our project, we want to put in place a development philosophy that is as close as possible to that of a company. Thus, we wish to work with the maximum GitHub options. In particular, we use the issues to list all the tasks to be performed and assign them to someone. Then, each issue is linked to a branch on which it is developed. Finally, once the task is done, it is added to the development branch via a pull request which must be reviewed by at least one other member of the team.

The milestones of the project will be rendered as releases published from the main branch. A pull request can only be performed on the main branch if all members of the project have reviewed it.

## feature implementation

1. Add an issue.
2. Create the associated branch.
3. Develop, commit and push on this branch.
4. Create a pull request on GitHub and assign reviewers.
5. Reviewers comment and asks for changes. (Optional) 
6. Developer applies changes. (If reviewer asked for)
7. Reviewers approve the merge request.
8. The branch is merged to the "develop" branch.
