## Rules

Our game is a strategy board game in which two to four players act as the leaders of history’s most memorable civilizations. Over the course of the game, they will expand their domains, gain new technologies, and build many of humanity’s greatest wonders. In the end, one civilization will rise above all others to leave its indelible mark upon history. 

### Playing the game
Our game is played over a series of turns. As the players take turns, they use their cards to build their civilizations from single cities to sprawling empires filled with wonders and technology. Players continue to take turns in clockwise order until the game ends. A player wins the game by completing one agenda on each victory card. Additionally, world events occur periodically that affect the map and all of the players, such as barbarian attacks. Before each of the first player’s turns (excluding the first turn).

**The focus row**

A player’s turn revolves around the concept of the focus row, which is the row of five cards below his or her focus bar. The focus row represents a nation’s various pursuits, such as scientific advancements, cultural developments, and military production. Each focus row has five slots, one for each card. 
The cards in a player’s focus row shift to different slots as the player takes turns. A card generally shifts toward the fifth slot until it is used, which is when it moves back to the first slot. From there, it will slowly shift toward the fifth slot again. This process represents the investment of time; a card resolved in the fifth slot has a greater impact than a card resolved in the first slot. A key strategy in the game is knowing when to resolve a card in a low slot for its immediate effect and when to wait to resolve a card for its maximum effect.

**The player turn**


A player’s turn consists of three steps: 
1. Choose a Card: The player chooses one of the five cards in his or her focus row.
2. Resolve the Card: The player resolves the chosen card’s effect
3. Reset the Card: The player picks up the chosen card, shifts all cards in lower slots to the right by one slot, and then places the chosen card in the first slot (automatically done).

After the player resets the chosen card, the turn ends and the next player in clockwise order takes the next turn.

### Key concepts
**Spaces and terrain**
Each hex on a map tile is a space. Spaces on the map have a terrain represented by art. The five basic types of terrain each correspond to a slot on the focus bar: grassland (1), hills (2), forest (3), desert (4), and mountains (5). A terrain’s slot number is its difficulty. Terrain affects many aspects of the game. In general, terrain that corresponds to a higher slot is more difficult to expand into and more difficult to conquer. The sixth terrain type, water, does not appear on the focus bar. Water has a difficulty of one, but players generally cannot interact with water unless a card specifically allows them to do so. When a space appears to have more than one terrain, its terrain is the type that covers the most area in the space.
