## Rules

Our game is a strategy board game in which two to four players act as the leaders of history’s most memorable civilizations. Over the course of the game, they will expand their domains, gain new technologies, and build many of humanity’s greatest wonders. In the end, one civilization will rise above all others to leave its indelible mark upon history. 

### Playing the game

Our game is played over a series of turns. As the players take turns, they use their cards to build their civilizations from single cities to sprawling empires filled with wonders and technology. Players continue to take turns in clockwise order until the game ends. A player wins the game by completing one agenda on each victory card. Additionally, world events occur periodically that affect the map and all of the players, such as barbarian attacks. Before each of the first player’s turns (excluding the first turn).

**The difficulty row**

A player’s turn revolves around the concept of the difficulty row, which is the row of five cards below his or her difficulty bar. The difficulty row represents a nation’s various pursuits, such as scientific advancements, cultural developments, and military production. Each difficulty row has five slots, one for each card. 
The cards in a player’s difficulty row shift to different slots as the player takes turns. A card generally shifts toward the fifth slot until it is used, which is when it moves back to the first slot. From there, it will slowly shift toward the fifth slot again. This process represents the investment of time; a card resolved in the fifth slot has a greater impact than a card resolved in the first slot. A key strategy in the game is knowing when to resolve a card in a low slot for its immediate effect and when to wait to resolve a card for its maximum effect.

**The player turn**

A player’s turn consists of three steps: 
1. Choose a Card: The player chooses one of the five cards in his or her difficulty row.
2. Resolve the Card: The player resolves the chosen card’s effect
3. Reset the Card: The player picks up the chosen card, shifts all cards in lower slots to the right by one slot, and then places the chosen card in the first slot (automatically done).

After the player resets the chosen card, the turn ends and the next player in clockwise order takes the next turn.

### Key concepts

**Spaces and terrain**

Each hex on a map tile is a space. Spaces on the map have a terrain represented by art. The five basic types of terrain each correspond to a slot on the difficulty bar: grassland (1), hills (2), forest (3), desert (4), and mountains (5). A terrain’s slot number is its difficulty. Terrain affects many aspects of the game. In general, terrain that corresponds to a higher slot is more difficult to expand into and more difficult to conquer. The sixth terrain type, water, does not appear on the difficulty bar. Water has a difficulty of one, but players generally cannot interact with water unless a card specifically allows them to do so. When a space appears to have more than one terrain, its terrain is the type that covers the most area in the space.

**Resources and natural wonders**

Resources and natural wonders power the creation of amazing world wonders. There are four types of resources: antiquity, stone, oil, diamond. Players can collect these resources from the map and spend them when building world wonders. When a player spends a resource, it is returned it to the supply. A natural wonder can be spent as a resource of the type shown on it. However, when a natural wonder token is spent, it is not returned to the supply. The natural wonder an be spent again during future turns, but it cannot be spent more than once per turn. Spaces with natural wonder do not have a terrain type, but the terrain difficulty of all natural wonder spaces is five.

**Cities and mature cities**

Cities are the focal points around which empires are built. They allow players to extend into new areas of the map. Mature cities are fully developed cities that contribute to the well-being of a player’s civilization. They periodically generate boxes (which are described later) and act as new starting points for caravans. A city is mature when each space adjacent to it either contains a friendly pawn or is a water space. Cities on the edge of the map can mature faster because they have fewer adjacent spaces.

### Difficulty cards 

There are five types of difficulty cards. A priori card’s type is indicated by an icon in the upper-left corner. Each player’s difficulty row contains one card of each type. During the game, players acquire advanced versions of their starting difficulty cards, which have a greater impact on the game. An advanced card is resolved using the same rules as the starting card of that type, but it may have an additional effect (e.g., allowing caravans to cross water). The following sections describe the rules for each type of difficulty card.

**Culture** 

Culture difficulty cards allow players to place pawns, which expands territory and claims resources. The card’s difficulty row slot determines which types of terrain the player can place pawns on. To place a pawn , the player takes one of his or her unused pawns and places it on a space adjacent to a friendly city. If that space contains a resource or natural wonder, that resource or natural wonder  is earned by the player. The player must note the following rules: 

♦ The player cannot place the pawn on a water space or on any space whose terrain corresponds to a higher difficulty row slot than the culture card’s slot. All natural wonders are treated as having a terrain difficulty of five. 

♦ The space cannot contain a barbarian, city, city-state, or pawn. 

♦ The pawn is first placed unreinforced

**Science** 

The science difficulty card advances a player’s tech wheel, allowing the player to discover new technologies. The card’s difficulty row slot determines how much the wheel advances. Each difficulty card has a tech level, and some spaces on the tech wheel are paired with a tech level: When the wheel’s pointer advances to (or passes) a tech level space, the player may gain a new difficulty card. He or she can choose any card from his or her difficulty card deck whose tech level exactly matches the tech level reached on the wheel. The chosen card replaces the card of the same type in his or her difficulty row.
