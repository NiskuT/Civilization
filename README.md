# Civilization

This is a school project of four french students of the [ENSEA](<www.ensea.fr/>). During our last year of school, we were ask to adapt a board game into a video game. Thus, we choose to implement the game "Civilization: A New Dawn".

## Constraints

Our build system must use [this template](<www.github.com/cbares/plt>).

Other constraints are:

* We must create an UML diagram of our project with [Dia](<www.dia-installer.de/>). This diagram is used to generate all the header files of the project thanks to the open source software "dia2code". Thus we should not create header files by ourselves.
* We must use SFML as graphic lirary.
* The game must be multiplayer with a server part.
* The game must implement 3 different types of AI.
